# Day 39 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 35** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
It focuses on **loops**, **conditionals**, and **user input handling**, with slightly more logical and interactive problems tested directly in the browser console.

📌 **About the Day 35 Task**  
Day 35 was focused on applying **JavaScript loops and conditionals** to real-world style logical problems.  
The goal was to go beyond basic syntax and practice **problem-solving using loops**, **validations**, and **decision-making** with user inputs.

✨ **Task Description**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **While & For Loops** | Used for repetition and iteration over user inputs and numeric ranges. |
| **Conditional Logic** | Implemented logical decisions using **if**, **else if**, and **else** statements. |
| **User Input Handling** | Used **prompt()**, **Number()**, and **isNaN()** to take and validate user inputs. |
| **Practical Scenarios** | Created logical mini-programs like password validation, ATM simulation, and counting logic. |
| **Break & Continue** | Applied loop control statements for precise iteration handling. |
| **Counters & Accumulators** | Used variables to count occurrences or accumulate sums dynamically. |

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript** – Loops, conditionals, and user input handling  
- **Browser Console** – For interactive execution and output testing  
- **HTML (optional)** – For embedding and testing scripts  

## 🧩 Practice Questions

### Level 2 – Slightly Tougher but Logical

11. **Allow only 3 attempts to enter correct password**  
    Checks for correct input within 3 tries. Locks account if incorrect all three times.

12. **Ask user for words until they type “stop” and count how many times “yes” appeared**  
    Demonstrates string comparison, loop continuation, and counter increment logic.

13. **Print numbers divisible by 7 from 1 to 50**  
    Uses modulo operator `%` to filter divisible numbers.

14. **Sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 30**  
    Adds all odd numbers and displays the total using an accumulator variable.

15. **Keep asking number until user enters an even number**  
    Uses a continuous loop and input validation to check for even input.

16. **Print numbers between two user inputs**  
    Takes start and end values from the user and prints numbers in the given range.

17. **Print only first 3 odd numbers from 1 to 20**  
    Uses a counter and `break` statement to stop loop after 3 odd numbers.

18. **Ask user 5 numbers and count how many are positive**  
    Demonstrates counting based on user input using a `while` loop.

19. **ATM Simulator – Allow 3 withdrawals**  
    Simulates ATM transactions by deducting withdrawal amounts and checking balance validity.

📖 **Learning Outcome**  
Through this task, I learned how to:  
- Use **while** and **for** loops effectively in logical problems  
- Apply **break** and **continue** for controlled loop flow  
- Handle and validate **user input** correctly using **trim()**, **isNaN()**, and **Number()**  
- Use **counters** and **accumulators** to track occurrences and sums  
- Simulate **real-life scenarios** like password attempts and ATM withdrawals  
- Write **clean, readable, and error-handled JavaScript code**

🌟 **Acknowledgement**  
This task was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0** under the guidance of **Harsh Bhaiya**.  

It helped me strengthen my understanding of **loop-based logic**, **user validation**, and **conditional problem-solving** through practical and interactive examples.
